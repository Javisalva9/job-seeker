    "title": "Performance Engineer - Open Source",
    "company": "Canonical",
    "description": "\n\nCanonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.\n\nThe company is founder led, profitable and growing.\n\nWe have created a new career path at Canonical for Performance Engineers who bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.\n\nAs an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act as drivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus 'percorr' because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously 'dark' aspects of their work.\n\nWe also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.\n\nIf they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to be truly exceptional individuals, and also leaders who are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs. There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.\n\nThis is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see

    "description": "\n\nLead Engineer, Common Voice\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation is a California nonprofit public-benefit organization. Our mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to all! Today, this includes making sure artificial intelligence (AI) and data driven technology are more trustworthy.\n\nOver the next few years, the majority of our internet health programs will be on ensuring more trustworthy AI. For us, this means two things: human agency is a core part of how AI is built and integrated and corporate accountability is real and implemented. As part of this effort, we are exploring projects that invite the public to participate in creating trustworthy AI by willingly creating and donating data.\n\nMost significantly, this includes the Common Voice project, which aims to shape the future of voice AI! Voice AI leaves most languages, accents and demographics behind. This project seeks to build openly available data sets for training machine-learning driven voice technologies. The core of this project is a platform that supports language communities and individual volunteers to “donate their voice” to an open data set, which anyone can then download for commercial or non-commercial use.\n\nThe Lead Engineer for Common Voice will be part of a team of three engineers working directly for the project - and as this project is open source, also supported by hundreds of passionate Common Voice volunteers. You will work across the stack.\n\nYou will:\n\nWork directly with the Product Director to shape and inform all aspects of the product roadmap\n\nTranslate strategic product requirements into engineering requirements in close collaboration with the other engineers - you will take the lead on deciding architectural direction and clearly weigh the trade offs between different paths\n\nYou will partner with the Product Manager and Designer to create technical content for PRDs, decide on appropriate ticket articulation, sizing and support allocating tickets between team members\n\nYou will line-manage 2 software engineers, helping them to grow and thrive in their roles. You will use both day-to-day code reviews and regular pairing, and more structured rhythms like progression reviews, to support them.  \n\nYou will be hands-on with the codebase - this is a small team, and you should still expect to help deliver features using a mixture of languages, frameworks and tooling, including HTML, CSS, React, Typescript, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, MySQL, Python and more that support the Common Voice platform and dataset\n\nYou will have primary responsibility for ensuring the security, logging, performance and accessibility of the platform - this means you will support security incident handling (including, on very rare occasions, responding to cyber-emergencies outside of working hours)\n\nYou will be excited to lead technical discovery processes and enshrine engineering best practice, improving tooling, and considering how to use AI to augment workflows\n\nPartner with the community management team to understand the wide and diverse community of software engineers, language activists and data scientists globally who use and contribute to Common Voice, and respond to that community’s needs, for example by reviewing their PRs \n\nCollaborate with designers to build and deploy prototypes and experiments that test experience concepts. You will help plan for iterations inclusive of accessibility and responsive design standard methodologies.\n\nCommunicate clearly, thoughtfully and regularly - this is a remote, distributed team with a strong culture of warmth, trust and openness. \n\nBe able to roll with ambiguity and change - we are making several transitions within the platform, and within the organisation.

    "title": "Performance Engineer - Open Source",
    "company": "Canonical",
    "description": "\n\nCanonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.\n\nThe company is founder led, profitable and growing.\n\nWe have created a new career path at Canonical for Performance Engineers who bring exceptional clarity to software performance, correctness and efficiency. We are adding these roles to every engineering team at the company.\n\nAs an open source platform, we have teams that work at every level of the software stack - from the kernel up through server and desktop applications, all the way to the web. We are adding roles with this focus in every engineering team in the company, to act as drivers of performance engineering skills, tools, culture and insights to our entire product range. We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills. We call this career focus 'percorr' because we have found that the same deep insights that enable sophisticated performance measurement and design also enable teams to improve their harnesses and frameworks for correctness. Understanding not only the application, but the runtime, the compiler, and the system, all the way down to the CPU, gives an engineer the ability to think creatively and with insight about the right things to measure, and the right ways to verify correctness. We have found that performance engineers will often improve the deepest and trickiest areas of our test harnesses, and unblock their teams to test and measure previously 'dark' aspects of their work.\n\nWe also have teams that work with every major silicon vendor and cloud, with a particular emphasis on performance optimisation of the entire stack for that architecture, CPU family or hypervisor. Our goal is to ensure that Ubuntu users can select whatever platform they want for their workloads and know they have access to the very best performance and efficiency across the entire stack from kernel to codec.\n\nIf they wish, we will enable performance and correctness engineers to move between products every two years, so that they have the opportunity to raise the bar for performance in an array of products over time, and also that teams have the benefit of fresh eyes on their processes, thinking, harnesses, dashboards and code. Our performance and correctness leads are expected to be truly exceptional individuals, and also leaders who are confident setting expectations of change, sharing insights and skills, running initiatives and programs. There is no way to move a meaningful codebase without also moving the people behind it.\n\nThis is a career path for perfectionists and precision artists. Whether you have a particular language focus - C, C++, Rust, Golang, Python, Java, Flutter-Dart or others - or a particular love of the kernel or hardware or CPU instruction set, whether you see yourself as driving perceived user experience through performance or optimising the efficiency of data centers to reduce carbon footprint, this process is the best way to find a role at Canonical that speaks to your precision, rigour, insight and drive.\n\nLocation: We have teams in every time zone, and can accommodate applications from almost any country.\n\nLow-level CPU insights and assembly

    "title": "Lead Engineer - Common Voice",
    "company": "Mozilla",
    "description": "\n\nLead Engineer, Common Voice\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation is a California nonprofit public-benefit organization. Our mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to all! Today, this includes making sure artificial intelligence (AI) and data driven technology are more trustworthy.\n\nOver the next few years, the majority of our internet health programs will be on ensuring more trustworthy AI. For us, this means two things: human agency is a core part of how AI is built and integrated and corporate accountability is real and implemented. As part of this effort, we are exploring projects that invite the public to participate in creating trustworthy AI by willingly creating and donating data.\n\nMost significantly, this includes the Common Voice project, which aims to shape the future of voice AI! Voice AI leaves most languages, accents and demographics behind. This project seeks to build openly available data sets for training machine-learning driven voice technologies. The core of this project is a platform that supports language communities and individual volunteers to “donate their voice” to an open data set, which anyone can then download for commercial or non-commercial use.\n\nThe Lead Engineer for Common Voice will be part of a team of three engineers working directly for the project - and as this project is open source, also supported by hundreds of passionate Common Voice volunteers. You will work across the stack.\n\nYou will:\n\nWork directly with the Product Director to shape and inform all aspects of the product roadmap\n\nTranslate strategic product requirements into engineering requirements in close collaboration with the other engineers - you will take the lead on deciding architectural direction and clearly weigh the trade offs between different paths\n\nYou will partner with the Product Manager and Designer to create technical content for PRDs, decide on appropriate ticket articulation, sizing and support allocating tickets between team members\n\nYou will line-manage 2 software engineers, helping them to grow and thrive in their roles. You will use both day-to-day code reviews and regular pairing, and more structured rhythms like progression reviews, to support them.  \n\nYou will be hands-on with the codebase - this is a small team, and you should still expect to help deliver features using a mixture of languages, frameworks and tooling, including HTML, CSS, React, Typescript, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, MySQL, Python and more that support the Common Voice platform and dataset\n\nYou will have primary responsibility for ensuring the security, logging, performance and accessibility of the platform - this means you will support security incident handling (including, on very rare occasions, responding to cyber-emergencies outside of working hours)\n\nYou will be excited to lead technical discovery processes and enshrine engineering best practice, improving tooling, and considering how to use AI to augment workflows\n\nPartner with the community management team to understand the wide and diverse community of software engineers, language activists and data scientists globally who use and contribute to Common Voice, and respond to that community’s needs, for example by reviewing their PRs \n\nCollaborate with designers to build and deploy prototypes and experiments that test experience concepts. You will help plan for iterations inclusive of accessibility and responsive design standard methodologies.\n\nCommunicate clearly, thoughtfully and regularly - this is a remote, distributed team with a strong culture of warmth, trust and openness. \n\nBe able to roll with ambiguity and change - we are making several transitions within the platform, and within the organisation.
